Bahirdar University and Gojjam
I began higher education at Bahirdar University, where the academic experience gave way to a deeper cultural journey—immersed in Gojjam traditions, the beauty of Lake Tana, and the rhythm of university life. After one semester, I left with a profound appreciation for the region’s heritage.

Life in Addis Ababa
I moved to Addis Ababa and re-enrolled at St. Mary University to study Marketing, where I balance academics with my passions for tourism, art, and creative storytelling. Inspired by the city’s energy and diversity, I’m living marketing—connecting people with places and experiences through creativity and purpose.
